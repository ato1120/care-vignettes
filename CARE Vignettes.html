After you walk down the street some more you turn left into your apartment building. You scan your student ID by the door and wait for the beep then open the door. You climb 6 flights of stairs and walk down a narrow hallway lined with doors. 

[[Next... -&gt; story4]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name=" story4" tags="dorm" position="701,101" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
The apartment building has general living noises you hear as you’re passing and smell something sweet as if someone had lit a candle or were possibly baking. You stop in front of a door with the wooden letter H on it and fumble in your pocket for your keys. Upon opening the door you’re greeted by your roommate Alex, who is sitting on the sofa reading a book. 
“Hey Sam! How’re you doing today?” 

[[&quot;I&#39;m doing fine. -&gt; story4.1]]

You look back up at Alex who had moved from the couch to kitchen. He was dipping a spoon into a peanut butter jar and smearing the peanut butter onto a peeled banana. 

[[Several days later... -&gt; story7]]

&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
You pick up the pace as you reach the door to the cafe. People exiting brush past, and you notice the place is fully packed. Tables are full and noise is bustling as you scan the room, looking for your peers. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a hand waving and it’s not long before you realize the hand is waving at you. It’s Robert, one of the lab members. you recognize the faces of the rest of the lab as you steadily walk over to their table, slipping and weaving past occupied chairs and other customers patrolling the space.

“Thanks for making it Troy.” Dr. Smith says as you find an empty seat at the table. 
You smile. “Good morning, everyone.”
“Drink’s are on me for today! Everyone else is already settled, what would you like, Sam?” 

[[Ask for a drink -&gt; drink]]

“Great! I’ll be right back” Dr.Smith stands up and heads for the counter. And not too long he comes back with a latte and hands it to you. 

[[&quot;Thank you.&quot; -&gt; story9]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name=" story9" tags="table" position="305,599" size="100,100">&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
Dr.Smith claps his hands. 
“Alright! Now that everyone’s here, I’d like to just get right into it. Let’s have everyone go around real quick and discuss future plans and aspirations after you graduate!” 
Dr.Smith glances at Robert. “Robert, how about we start with you?” 

Robert straightens up a bit “Sure, um... For me, I’d like to start off a career in web services, and maybe work on game development on the side or in my free time.” 
“That sounds great!” Dr.Smith replies.

Ashley went next. “I’m actually not entirely sure of what I want to do...Being a student itself is taking a lot out of me lately, and I haven’t really gotten a chance to set time off to really think about what my future is…” She looks around nervously before lowering her head down in embarrassment. 

Dr.Smith smiles. “That’s totally fine Ashley. It’s important to take the time to find something that you love first. Let me know if you’d like to sit down sometime and we can personally discuss options for you.” 
Ashley pulls her head back up and her lips slowly form a subtle smile. “Thanks.”

“I’d like to take my chances with grad school… I want to be able to advance my career in the future, and I’ve also become more interested in being more involved with research and academic publishings.” 
Dr.Smith is beaming. “That is wonderful! There are so many opportunities with excellent programs. If you want to get started, I could send some summer internships your way that could certainly boost your application if you were to apply.”

[[&quot;That would be great!&quot; -&gt; story12]]

“I actually plan to take a little break from academics. I’ve always planned on traveling for a bit and I want to take the opportunity to think about what I plan to spend the rest of my life doing.” 

Dr.Smith’s brows go up. “How exciting! Not many have the courage to decide something so major for themselves like that. I hope it all works out for you. In the future, if you decide to continue your studies, I’d be glad to help you in figuring out your next steps.”

“I think I’m kind of on the same boat as Ashley here…” you steal a quick glance at Ashley as your eyes meet, and she responds with a warm smile. You continue, “I’ve actually put a lot of thought into what I want and there hasn’t been anything that I am confident in enough to be set on.” 

Dr.Smith nods his head. “Of course, Troy. No need to feel down in any way, even though I did call you all to hear to discuss your futures. Know that if either of you need any further consulting, you know how to reach me.” 

[[&quot;Thanks.-&gt; story12]]

Dr. Smith leaves to get a refill.
*Ping*
You get a text from your roommate: 
&quot;How&#39;s the lunch going? How do you feel right now?&quot;

The rest of the lunch goes by fairly quickly. You learn the last member of your lab, Mia is going to be using his degree to help with her family business, creating a website for their real estate company. You all walk to the bus stop together before parting ways. 

(set: $q2 to &quot;test&quot;)
(set: $surveyLink to it +&quot;?q1=&quot; + (text:$q1) + &quot;&amp;q2&quot; + (text:$q2))

You add on, “I think I’m gonna make something to eat and then later I have a meeting with my lab.”
“You work with Professor Smith right? I’ve heard a lot about him but never met him what do you think of him?” 
“He’s been a good mentor so far. I’ve really enjoyed working in his lab.”
Alex tilts his head up trying to remember something. “Remind me who’s in your lab again?”
“Mia, Ashley, and Robert!”
Alex&#39;s eyes widen up. “Oh yeah! I know Ashley and Robert from the black student union meetings. I’m not sure I know Mia.” 
“Oh no way! Small world then. Yeah I doubt you’d know Mia she’s comp sci like me I don’t think either has taken a course in the design department.” 
“Yeah this is a big school. I’m shocked I even know two members of your lab.”
